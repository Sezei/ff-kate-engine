# Funky Friday Kate Engine
Funky Friday's 'essential' mods; Absolutely nothing that gives you advantages over your opponents, all absolutely client-sided.
decided on the name 'kate engine' both because of Kade and because my name's katherine (or kate for short lol)

i mean, it technically does mod ff to add new features just like kade did for fnf so dont point fingers at me

# Features (so far)
The 'mods' so far are the following;
- Optional No-Miss mode for Solo plays

# Planned Features
The following features are currently in planning stages, and won't be in the 'engine' for a while.
- an actual menu to toggle the mods - thinking about either making one just for this
- better score display?
- background for solo plays? (already tested, thinking about how to implement into the script)
