### Use Kate Engine at your own risk!
```diff
! Due to the nature of how to use Kate Engine, it is recommended to take safety precautions to avoid a permanent account deletion of your Roblox account.
! Myself, Lyte Interactive's Affliates, and whoever redirected you here have no control over what happens next if you get caught.

! Please be safe and don't cheat.

Funky Friday's modding framework; which by itself is a mod lol; Absolutely nothing that gives you advantages over your opponents, all absolutely client-sided.

# How to load (correctly)
I will not elaborate how to get the script into the game and stuff, but it's here;
```lua
local engine = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sezei/ff-kate-engine/main/loader.lua",true))()
```

or for the beta users;
```lua
local engine = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sezei/ff-kate-engine/beta/loader.lua",true))()
```

# Reporting bugs
If you encounter a bug, please either report it in Issues (https://github.com/Sezei/ff-kate-engine/issues) or if you feel courageous enough to fix it yourself, you can open a pull request by forking the script and sending it in the appropriate place. (https://github.com/Sezei/ff-kate-engine/pulls)

While there isn't a specific template you should follow, it's required that you add the following details, otherwise I won't be able to help;
- What the error is (Screenshot the F9 menu, as well as the Internal Console if one exists)
- What config are you using (the settings); You can send the .mp5 file that is generated when you save the config.
- The way you executed the script. (You know what I mean.)

Soon you will be able to share your own modcharts with pull requests in https://github.com/Sezei/ffke-modcharts/pulls
In order to get the asset, you can use the following;
```lua
setclipboard(engine:GetKEValue("SongID"));
```
